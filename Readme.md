ASCII
=====

ASCII is an ASCII line drawing app written for the iPhone in Objective-C for Stealth Co. The full brief is given below. Rest assured, I had my own take on how such an app should work. :)

Time given: 2-4 hours

Brief
-----

Write a small application that takes as input a set of line coordinates, and renders them to ASCII line art.

The program should accept an inputs of the form (x,y) – (x,y), (x,y) – (x,y), ... where (x,y) are the coordinates of the line segments. The program should accept an arbitrary number of line segments.

The coordinate range is between 0 and 19 on x and 0 to 9 on y, and the output should be a 20x10 array of ASCII characters.

The program should be able to handle any number of lines from any coordinates.

You should assume this project is intended for commercial use and code your solution accordingly.

### Installation

The app should be built using the latest version of Xcode (v7.3 or above), and can be run on the simulator or any suitable device.
